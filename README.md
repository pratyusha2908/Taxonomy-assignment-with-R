# Taxonomy-assignment-with-R
Taxonomy assignment using DADA2 pipelines and processing using phyloseq on R. Fastq files are processed using this pipeline.
This code covers data processing using DADA2, importing the output into phyloseq pipeline and obtaining abundance plots. For other types of analysis such as diversity indices and related plots, refer DADA2 [tutorial](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html)
